<h2 align="left" class="style1">Introduction to the ITIL applications </h2>
<p align="left" class="style1">Here you find a few simple user applications with an ITIL flavour. The applications are separate from the OneCMDB engine and interact with it using the OneCMDB Webservices interface. You access the applications from the menu at the left. The menu is organized with ITIL V3 terminology. Therefore, under <strong>Service Operation </strong>you will currently find applications for Incident and Problem Management. Under <strong>Service Transition </strong>you will find an Asset Management application.. </p>
<p align="left" class="style1">The applications are small and have limited functionality, but still provides some basic functionality for IT Service Management. Our intention with the applications is to demonstrate the capabilities of OneCMDB and how it can be used. The source code of the applications is open and can be used as an example when developing your own OneCMDB application.</p>
<p align="left" class="style1"><strong>Note: </strong>Do not use the <em>admin </em>login in the Incident and Problem Applications as they require a login that is associated with a Person, for instance <em>jsmith</em> in the default Basic Model. </p>
