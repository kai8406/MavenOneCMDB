NATURAL KEYS
</p>
<pre class="text">
Shows how CMDB Templates and Attributes will be populated with this transformation. 

The Natural Key function defines how new instances shall be created.
In this way you can normalize (not create duplicates) of the input data. 

Example:

Source Data in Excel
Row 1: Server A	Service X
Row 2: Server B	Service X
Row 3: Server C	Service Y

Result in the CMDB with no Template defined as Natural Key:
Server A -> Service X
Server B -> Service X
Server C -> Service Y

I.e. six instances are created


Result in the CMDB with Template "Service" defined as a Natural Key
Server A ->
	    Service X
Server B -> 

Server C -> Service Y

I.e. five instances are created

You can check the impact of having different Natural Keys by 
clicking on the 'Calculate Instances' button. The 'Number of instances' 
column will display the total number of instances that will be 
created. The 'Found in CMDB' indicates how many instances that
are already present in the CMDB, as identified by the Natural Key.

NOTE: The number indicates the instance count per template, 
      not per attribute.

In general each Template shall have one natural key checked.

When you are satisfied, select "Save" and then close the configurator.
