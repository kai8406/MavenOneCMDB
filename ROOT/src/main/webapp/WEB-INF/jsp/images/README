OneCmdb entities are expected to expose an attribute called `icon' which is
supposed to map to an image inside this directory. Each image is named as:

	<basename><size>.<ext>

The basename is what is found as value from the icon attribute. In cases when
the basename is missing, ``unknown'' is used as basename, and shpuld point a 
generic icon describing the _unknown_.

Sizes are expected to include:

* 16 - for SMALL  16px sizes
* 32 - for MEDIUM 32px sizes
* 48 - for LARGE  48px sizes

The extensions supported are (in search order):

* gif
* png
* jpg
* jpeg
